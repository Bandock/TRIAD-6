# TRIAD-6
A fantasy ternary computer that will provide retro gaming and application support.

This project is currently a very work-in-progress. However, that means one can still learn as the project gets developed.

As of right now, a desktop PC or a powerful embedded system is needed to run sufficiently.  The minimum right now is a Raspberry Pi 4 (which can operate between 34-35 to 61-63 FPS depending on instruction makeup, though could change to lower or higher as new features get added).
