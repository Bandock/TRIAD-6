# TRIAD-6
A fantasy ternary computer that will provide retro gaming and application support.

This project is currently a very work-in-progress. However, that means one can still learn as the project gets developed.

As of right now, a desktop PC or a powerful embedded system is needed to run sufficiently.  Heavy optimization is being attempted to make runnable on a Raspberry Pi 4 at least.
